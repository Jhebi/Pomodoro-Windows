# Pomodoro-Windows
Pomodoro App I'll be using while working on my computer

What the App does:
This app helps in productivity by providing a timer in order to follow the pomodoro method of learning. It notifies you when you need to take a 
rest and when you need to get back to work.

Why is it useful:
It's useful especially for me because often times, I forget to take breaks during work times. This not only reminds me to take a break but also
reminds me when I should be working and when I should be resting in order to make work more productive.

How to get started/How to use:
I will add the intallers here. The app will initially appear in the bottom left corner so it is not distracting. Then you can drag it anywhere 
on the screen. Operating the app itself is pretty straightforward, you set the time in minutes how long you want to work and how long you want
to rest. Then all you have to do is press start. Then you have the option to go start/pause the timer as well as to go back and change the
timer. There's also a quit button for both panels for you to close the app anytime.

Installers:


Feel free to give any suggestions to how I can improve. This is actual the very first desktop app I made complete with installer and all.
